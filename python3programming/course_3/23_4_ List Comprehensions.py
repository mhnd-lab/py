#23.4. List Comprehensions
#Python provides an alternative way to do map and filter operations, called a list comprehension. Many programmers find them easier to understand and write. List comprehensions are concise ways to create lists from other lists. The general syntax is:
# [<transformer_expression> for <loop_var> in <sequence> if <filtration_expression>]

#where the if clause is optional. For example,
things = [2, 5, 9]

yourlist = [value * 2 for value in things]

print(yourlist)
#The transformer expression is value * 2. The item variable is value and the sequence is things. 
# This is an alternative way to perform a mapping operation. 
# As with map, each item in the sequence is transformed into an item in the new list. 
# Instead of the iteration happening automatically, 
# however, we have adopted the syntax of the for loop which may make it easier to understand.
#Just as in a regular for loop, 
# the part of the statement for value in things says to execute some code once for each item in things. 
# Each time that code is executed, value is bound to one item from things. 
# The code that is executed each time is the transformer expression, 
# value * 2, rather than a block of code indented underneath the for statement. 
# The other difference from a regular for loop is that each time the expression is evaluated, 
# the resulting value is appended to a list. That happens automatically, 
# without the programmer explicitly initializing an empty list or appending each item.
#The if clause of a list comprehension can be used to do a filter operation. 
# To perform a pure filter operation, the expression can be simply the variable that is bound to each item.
#  For example, the following list comprehension will keep only the even numbers from the original list.

def keep_evens(nums):
    new_list = [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0]
    return new_list

print(keep_evens([3, 4, 6, 7, 0, 1]))

#You can also combine map and filter operations by chaining them together, 
# or with a single list comprehension.
things = [3, 4, 6, 7, 0, 1]
#chaining together filter and map:
# first, filter to keep only the even numbers
# double each of them
print(map(lambda x: x*2, filter(lambda y: y % 2 == 0, things)))

# equivalent version using list comprehension
print([x*2 for x in things if x % 2 == 0])


#2. The for loop below produces a list of numbers greater than 10. 
# Below the given code, use list comprehension to accomplish the same thing. 
# Assign it the the variable lst2. Only one line of code is needed.

L = [12, 34, 21, 4, 6, 9, 42]
lst = []
for x in L:
    if x > 10:
        lst.append(x)
print(lst)

lst2 = [num for num in L if num > 10]


#3. Write code to assign to the variable compri all the values of the key name in any of the sub-dictionaries in the dictionary tester. Do this using a list comprehension.

compri = [d['name'] for d in tester['info']]
